Adding Icons

## Adding Icons

To add an icon simply click on the + icon in the content panel.
Then select `Icon` from the list and click next.  
Now fill the form with a name like `iron-spring`,
and select a spritesheet (We will use `graphics/icons/iron-spring.png`)

Now click on `Finish`, we can now use the `iron-spring` icon in our items.
Speaking of that, let's add our new icon to the item we created last time!

### Using Icon in Item

Select the `iron-spring` item from the Content Panel and
set the Icon prop to our freshly created `iron-spring` icon.  

Don't forget to save! ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> )

### Whats next?

In the next guide we will add a recipe for our `iron-spring` item
so you can obtain it in game
